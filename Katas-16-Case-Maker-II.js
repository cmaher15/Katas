/* In this exercise, we will be building an advanced case maker that can convert strings into all different kinds of case styles; like camel, pascal, snake, or even kebab.

Note
This an extension to the previous Case Maker kata. Create a new file (and gist) for this kata instead of updating the one from your Case Maker submission.

Case Maker II
We will still be given an input string to convert. However, this time, we'll also be given a casing style to work with. The following code block will describe all the casing styles to support. We may also receive an array of casing styles, and each of these should be applied.

Input

const makeCase = function(input, case) {
  // Put your solution here
}

console.log(makeCase("this is a string", "camel"));
console.log(makeCase("this is a string", "pascal"));
console.log(makeCase("this is a string", "snake"));
console.log(makeCase("this is a string", "kebab"));
console.log(makeCase("this is a string", "title"));
console.log(makeCase("this is a string", "vowel"));
console.log(makeCase("this is a string", "consonant"));
console.log(makeCase("this is a string", ["upper", "snake"]));

Expected Output
thisIsAString
ThisIsAString
this_is_a_string
this-is-a-string
This Is A String
thIs Is A strIng
THiS iS a STRiNG
THIS_IS_A_STRING

Instruction
Create a function named makeCase that will receive an input string and one or more casing options. Return a new string that is formatted based on casing options:

Precedence of each of the casing styles are as follows, values higher in the list should be processed first:

camel, pascal, snake, kebab, title
vowel, consonant
upper, lower
Our function should be able to handle all of these cases.
